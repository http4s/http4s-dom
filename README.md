# http4s-dom

Use http4s in your browser with Scala.js! Check out the [live example](https://http4s.github.io/http4s-dom/) in the docs.


Features:

* A [`Client` implementation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.http4s/http4s-dom_sjs1_2.13/latest/org/http4s/dom/FetchClientBuilder.html) backed by [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
* A [`Service Worker` integration](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.http4s/http4s-dom_sjs1_2.13/latest/org/http4s/dom/ServiceWorker$.html) to install your `HttpRoutes` as a [`FetchEvent` handler](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/onfetch)
* Encoders for [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File), [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) and [`ReadableStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream)

Notably, http4s-dom can also be used to create _serverless_ apps with [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) which have adopted the same APIs used in the browser!
